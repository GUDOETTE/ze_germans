Hans hadn't had a bratwurst in years, and even his most impressive kopfkino skills were unable to remind him of the days when 
bratwurst literally grew on trees. He suddenly had a schnapsidee to attempt to find a bratwurst which had been outlawed in 
Berlin since "the incident".  A plan this cunning would need a disguise... luckily Hans had held on to his mother's dirndel
all these years. Donning the dirndel, he made his way to one of Berlin's bratwurst speakeasys, operating under the appearance of a well-known biergarten.
Hans reminisced on the days where he would wear lederhose and eat bratwursts while watching Schneewittchen. 
As Hans drove to the biergarten in his BMW, he couldn't help but fantasize about having a juicy bratwurst grace his tongue once again.
